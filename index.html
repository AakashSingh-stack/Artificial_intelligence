            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) is a large language
                model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, notable for enabling users to
                refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language
                used. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are taken into account at each stage
                of the conversation as a context.[2]

                ChatGPT is built upon GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, from OpenAI's proprietary series of foundational GPT models,
                fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning
                techniques.[3] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity,
                OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the
                GPT-3.5 based version, while the more advanced GPT-4 based version, as well as priority access to newer
                features, are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name "ChatGPT Plus".</p>

                engine and art gallery called Lexica that features artwork created with Stable Diffusion, one of the

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Luma AI is an innovative app and service developed by Luma Labs, a
                California-based company located in Palo Alto. It uses Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to capture 3D
                images with stunning photo-realistic detail. This technology is similar to what high-end gaming uses to
                create graphics that are almost indistinguishable from reality through ray-tracing.

                Whether you're an AI development expert or just curious about the technology, Luma's NERF technology
                allows you to create beautiful 3D images and videos easily and quickly. The user interface is simple to
                navigate, making it easy to get started and explore the powerful features of this impressive software.
